**Team:**  
Don Perkus, John Winter, Michael Zhang, and myself (Sean Osier)

**Situation:**
- WomenTechWomenYes International (WTWY), a hypothetical client, is a non-profit that aims to increase the participation of women in technology
- WTWY uses "street teams" at entrances to subway stations as a significant portion of their fundraising efforts
- WTWY engaged us to optimize the effectiveness of their street teams

**Recommendations:**  
**1. Optimal timing:** Weekday evenings  
**2. Optimal locations:** Factoring in pure subway traffic volume, proximity to nearby tech startups (and specifically  startups founded by or focused on women), and relative neighborhood affluence, our top stations:
  1. 34th and Herald Square
  2. 42nd and Time Square
  3. 34th and Penn Station
  4. 42nd and Grand Central
  5. 59th and Columbus
